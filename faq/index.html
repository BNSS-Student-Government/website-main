                    throughout the year. As a part of Student Government, you will be part of a bigger

		        <p>The Government election process is something for which Student Government is committed
                    to ensuring validity, accuracy, and efficiency. Students wishing to apply must complete

                    After completing supplementary materials, candidates will then be allowed to campaign
                    over the period of a week or participate in an interview. After counting the ballots
                    and completing the interview process, the new Student Government members will be

                    and council meetings. Being actively involved with Burnaby North campus life is one of
                    the many ways that you can give back and help staff and students recognize who you are
                    and your presence within the community. You can either directly run for Student
                    Government through Grade Representative or Executive positions during election week
                    or join your respective grade councils.</p>
